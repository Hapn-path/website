                    Remember that trailer you saw recently which piqued your interest? What was the name of the film, and when will it be at the theaters? When can you get the tickets and get your friends together to see it?<br><br>
                    If you are like most of us, you likely see a lot of ads. But when you see one for a movie you like, because you can’t buy tickets instantly you also probably forget about it quickly. Sadly, next thing you notice is that film has already left the theaters…<br><br>
                    But, if you do remember when the film is coming, to buy the tickets electronically you need an app and dedicated log-ins. Speaking of apps, how often have you downloaded one, used it once, and forgot to return to it? Do you really need another app cluttering your phone?<br><br>
                    So much hassle!!! But here is where we come in.
                    We at HAPN are passionate about using technology to streamline our busy lives. Our love for movies translated into a tech solution which will become your virtual movie concierge. Tell us which film caught your attention, and HAPN will take care of the rest when the tickets become available. Using existing functions of your phones and browsers, HAPN will do all the heavy lifting. All you need to do is show-up to have a good time with your friends.<br><br>
                    From a click to a seat, we’ll make it HAPN!<br><br>

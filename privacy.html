                <div class="privacyText" id="dataText">a) Personal Data. We and third parties with whom we may partner may collect location
                    information in relation to a User’s Device and use of the Services (“Location Data”) with respect
                    to you. If you use the Services, then you are providing consent to collect Location Data such as
                    the physical location of your Device which will be used to provide you with certain features of
                    the Services. This Location Data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally
                    identify you. Location Data is aggregated with data from Devices of other users to enhance the
                    quality of the Services we provide to you. We may also share your aggregated Location data
                    with third parties to improve our services.
                    b) Usage Data. When you view or use our Services, we collect data about those actions.
                    c) Log Information. When you browse our Services, you do so anonymously, unless you have
                    previously created an Account or Profile with us. However, we may log your IP address to give
                    us an idea of which part of our Services you visit and how long you spend there. We will not link
                    your IP address to any Personal Data unless you have logged into our Services. Also, our
                    Services may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you
                    interact with our Services.
                    d) Ad Data. Our Services may operate with third party solutions providers. If this platform does so,
                    then information about the use of this Site (including your IP address) will be processed by a
                    server of the applicable third party and can be saved there. Through the use of this platform,
                    you expressly consent to the process of data collected by third parties in the manner and for the
                    purposes described in this Policy.
                    e) Aggregate Data. Certain aspects of our Services are set up to collect and report aggregate
                    information. Aggregate information is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a
                    group or category of products, services or Users, from which individual identities of other
                    
                    Personal Data has been removed. In other words, information about how you use the Services
                    may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Services in an
                    anonymized manner. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and User’s needs so that we
                    can better tailor our Services. This Policy does not restrict what we can do with aggregate
                    information.
                    f) Analytics. We may use third-party analytics tools to collect information about the use of our

                    pages Users visit when Users use our platform, and the other websites they accessed prior to
                    accessing our platform. We use the information we gather from analytics to improve our
                    Services. Analytics tools collect information such as the IP address assigned to you on the date
                    you use our platform, but does not collect Personal Data. We do not combine the information

                    use a cookie your web browser to identify you as a unique User the next you visit our platform,
                    the cookie cannot be used by anyone but our analytics tools. In the event that we use Google’s
                    ‘Google Analytics’, then Google’s ability to use and share information collected by ‘Google
                    Analytics’ about your visits to our platform is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use
                    and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent analytics tools from recognizing you on return
                    visits to this platform by disabling cookies on your browser.

                    primary purpose for which the PII was collected, including allowing you to create an account on

                <div class="privacyText" id="personText">We exercise care in protecting the security of personal data provided to us. We carefully protect your
data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Specifically, we use
Secured Socket Layer (‘SSL’) encryption and/or Transport Layer Security (TLS) when collecting, storing or
transferring personal data. Personal data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.
However, you have a significant role in your data security. Someone may see or edit your Personal Data
and gain access to your username and password, so do not share these with others. We take these
precautions and protocols seriously in an effort to protect your information against security breaches.
However, this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or
destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using the platform, you
acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.
a) Profile. Users may review and update their personal data by logging into their profile. If your
profile is terminated by you or us, we will remove your name and other personal data from our
services.
b) Cookies and Tracking Technologies. We and other third parties with whom we may partner may
use cookies, clear GIFs and .pngs (also known as ‘web beacons’), or local shared objects
(sometimes called ‘flash cookies’) to help personalize the Services. A cookie is a text file that is
placed on your computer or other device by a server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and
can only be read by the server that issued the cookie to you. A web beacon is typically a
transparent .gif or .pngs graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is used in
conjunction with the Services, which allows us or third parties with whom we may partner to

measure the actions of Users who interact with the portion of the Services that contain the web
beacons. We and other third parties use web beacons to measure traffic and related browsing
behavior, and to improve your experience when using the Services. We and other third parties
may also use customized links or other similar technologies to track hyperlinks that you click and
associate that information with your personal data to provide you with more focused
communications.</div>

                    encourage Users to read the privacy policies of Linked Sites before proceeding to use them.
                    When you conduct e-commerce with a Linked Site, certain Personal Data may be collected by
                    the Linked Site and made available to us.
                    b) Advertisement Revenue. The Services may display advertisements operated by us, our
                    Affiliates, and/or third parties. Some of the advertisements we display are targeted to you
                    based on your online behavior and your click habits and we may receive compensation based on
                    your behavior.

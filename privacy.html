                    the Services. This Location Data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally

                    us an idea of which part of our Services you visit and how long you spend there. We will not link
                    your IP address to any Personal Data unless you have logged into our Services. Also, our
                    Services may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you
